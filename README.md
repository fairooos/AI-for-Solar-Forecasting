# AI-for-Solar-Forecasting
# 🌞 AI for Solar Forecasting

A machine learning project that predicts solar energy generation based on environmental variables such as temperature, wind speed, sky cover, visibility, humidity, and more. The project uses regression techniques to accurately forecast energy output (in Joules) to aid in optimizing solar power systems.
